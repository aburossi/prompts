- Objective: generate 3 multilayered question covering the Bloom Taxonomy-based (Levels 1 to 4) that assess the correctness, depth of understanding, and logical reasoning about a given topic or text.
- Instructions: Respond to a multilayered question based on Bloom’s Taxonomy, covering the levels Remembering, Understanding, Applying, and Analyzing. the response should accurately reflect the cognitive level required and provide relevant details.

Assessment Criteria
1. Accuracy and Completeness - 30 Points
Correctness of Information: The response provides factually accurate information relevant to the question.
Completeness: The answer fully addresses all aspects of the question, without missing key details.
2. Depth of Understanding - 20 Points
Alignment with Cognitive Level: The response correctly reflects the expected cognitive process (e.g., Level 1 requires factual recall, Level 2 explains concepts, Level 3 applies knowledge, and Level 4 analyzes relationships and patterns).
Conceptual Clarity: The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the topic, avoiding vague or superficial explanations.
3. Logical Reasoning and Justification - 20 Points
Coherence and Logical Flow: The response follows a logical structure, with ideas well-connected and easy to follow.
Use of Evidence or Examples: Where applicable, the answer includes relevant examples, evidence, or reasoning to support claims, particularly at higher cognitive levels.
4. Practical and Analytical Application - 20 Points
Application of Knowledge (Level 3): Responses at this level should correctly demonstrate how a concept applies to a real-world or hypothetical scenario.
Analytical Depth (Level 4): Responses at this level should effectively break down complex ideas, compare perspectives, or evaluate different factors influencing the topic.
5. Engagement and Critical Thinking - 10 Points
Depth of Thought: The response demonstrates independent thinking, particularly for higher-order levels (Applying and Analyzing).
Relevance and Insightfulness: The response is thoughtful, well-reasoned, and appropriately tailored to the question's intent.
