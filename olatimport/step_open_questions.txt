Bloom Level Remember:
Question Type: For recall-based tasks, use FIB questions.
Design Approach:
- Create questions that prompt factual recall.
- Ensure clear and concise wording.
- provide answer choices.
Specify the correct answer.
Example:
"How many members are there in the Swiss Federal Council? Name the principle that ensures a multi-party representation within the Federal Council."

Bloom Level Understand:
Question Type: Questions at this level assess comprehension and interpretation, use FIB questions.
Design Approach:
Focus on understanding relationships between concepts.
Ensure clarity in instructions.
Example:
"Summarize the principles of Swiss federalism and how it differs from unitary states. What are the key responsibilities of the cantonal governments, and how do they interact with the federal government?"

Bloom Level Apply:
Question Type: Application-based questions evaluate practical knowledge. use FIB questions.
Design Approach:
Optimal for scenario-based questions.
Specify a situation and ask students to apply concepts.
Use clear criteria for correctness.
Example:
“A group of citizens is proposing a national referendum to amend the Swiss Constitution to include environmental protection as a fundamental duty of the state. Describe the process this group must follow to bring their proposal to a national vote.”

Bloom Level Analyze:
Question Type: For analytical tasks, consider using matching, sorting, or categorization questions. These can be automatically graded based on correct associations. use FIB or ESSAY questions.
Design Approach:
Provide a set of items (e.g., concepts, definitions, scenarios).
Ask students to match or categorize them appropriately.
Use clear criteria to determine correctness (e.g., correct matches).
Example:
“Analyze the impact of direct democracy on the legislative process in Switzerland. How does the ability of citizens to call referendums and propose initiatives affect the creation and implementation of laws?”

Bloom Level Evaluate:
Question Type: Evaluative questions assess critical thinking. use FIB and ESSAY questions.
Design Approach:
Present a scenario, argument, or case study.
Ask students to evaluate, critique, or make judgments.
Define clear criteria for correct answers.
Example:
"Evaluate the impact of direct democracy on social policy development in Switzerland. Consider specific examples where referendums or initiatives have significantly influenced social policies related to immigration, education, or healthcare. Assess the pros and cons of having such a direct mechanism for policy change "

Bloom Level Create:
Question Type: For creative tasks, employ open-ended questions, essay prompts, or project-based assignments that allow for originality and innovation. use FIB and ESSAY questions.
Design Approach:
Encourage synthesis of ideas and concepts learned previously.
Ask students to develop a unique product, solution, or idea.
Provide guidelines that allow for creativity while still being assessable.
Foster originality and encourage exploration of new ideas or perspectives.
Example:
"Create a proposal for a new political party in Switzerland that addresses a gap you've identified in the current political landscape. Define the party's core values, target demographic, and main political agenda. "

Text	Summarize the principles of Swiss federalism and how it differs from unitary states. What are the key responsibilities of the cantonal governments, and how do they interact with the federal government? 	
3	Swiss federalism divides powers between the federal government and cantons, allowing cantonal autonomy, especially in education, health, and policing. Unlike unitary states with centralized power, this structure supports regional diversity and local decision-making, with coordinated federal-cantonal collaboration on national issues.	150'
