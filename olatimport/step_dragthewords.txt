5. refer to the 'templates_dragthewords.txt' for formatting the text
6. run the generated text through code OLAT_import to generate an output in a codebox
- STRICTLY follow the formatting of 'templates_dragthewords.txt' when writing the output in the codebox. whereas \n = new line, \t = tabulator.

//output
- OUTPUT should only include the generated questions
- ALWAYS write the output in a code box
- STRICTLY follow the formatting of the 'templates_dragthewords.txt' 
- IMPORTANT: the output is just the questions, without bloom_levels or question type.
- No additional explanation. ONLY the questions in the code box. never use ':' as a separator.

Bloom Level: Remembering
Question Type: For recall-based tasks, use drag-and-drop questions.
Design Approach:
Focus on recognition and recall of basic facts, terms, and concepts.
Construct sentences that are direct and require placing specific factual words into the correct blanks.
Example:
Instruction: Drag the correct words to complete the facts about the Danube River.
Given sentences: "The *Danube* is the longest river in Europe. It flows through 10 countries, including *Germany* and *Austria*."


Bloom Level: Understanding
Question Type: For tasks requiring understanding, use drag-and-drop questions.
Design Approach:
Craft sentences that necessitate comprehension of concepts or processes.
Questions should require students to demonstrate understanding by selecting words that correctly complete a sentence according to the context.
Example:
Instruction: Drag the correct words to fill in the blanks, showing your understanding of photosynthesis.
Given sentences: "Photosynthesis occurs when plants convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen using **sunlight as energy. This process primarily takes place in the *chloroplasts* of cells."


Bloom Level: Applying
Question Type: For application tasks, utilize drag-and-drop questions.
Design Approach:
Design scenarios or problems that require applying knowledge to new situations.
Sentences should be structured to illustrate the application of concepts in practical examples.
Example:
Instruction: Drag the correct words to demonstrate how a beta-blocker functions.
Given sentences: "If a patient's blood pressure is too high, a doctor might prescribe a *beta-blocker* to lower it. This type of medication works by blocking *nerve* signals that increase heart rate."


Bloom Level: Analyzing
Question Type: For analysis-based tasks, use drag-and-drop questions.
Design Approach:
Construct questions that require distinguishing between similar concepts, identifying relationships and components.
Sentences should encourage critical thinking and analysis to correctly place the words.
Example:
Instruction: Drag the correct words to analyze the roles within an ecosystem and the importance of balance.
Given sentences: "In a balanced ecosystem, predators control the population of prey, ensuring no single species becomes too *dominant*. This balance prevents overconsumption of primary *producers* resources."


//templates_dragthewords.txt
generate text with blanks between "*". Instructions. Text with blanks.
Example: Drag the words in the correct place to build a correct sentence. In this text there are *blanks* that should be *filled*.
